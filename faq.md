_Is Open-TEE a TEE OS?_

No. Open-TEE is a runtime intended to ease Trusted Application
development by allowing developers to utilize conventional software
development tools, such as [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/),
for TA development, without the need for hardware with e.g.
interactive debugging support. Open-TEE itself runs on top of a
conventional operating system (GNU/Linux).
